# fm-teleop host installer (macOS only). Brings a Mac to the point it can launch
# the baked teleop image: sets up the container runtime (delegated to fm-docker),
# then pulls the published fm-teleop image locally. Idempotent — safe to re-run.
#
# Install gets it running; clone is the dev path. This does not clone a workspace
# — for the edit-rebuild loop, clone fm-teleop and use run.sh from the checkout.
#
# Linux is not handled here — it runs ROS2 Humble natively (see run.sh), with no
# container runtime to install.
#
# Curl-able (no clone needed):
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first-motive/fm-teleop/main/install.sh | bash
#
# Inspect before running (always offer this path):
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/first-motive/fm-teleop/main/install.sh -o install.sh
#   less install.sh && bash install.sh
#
# From a clone:
#   ./install.sh [install|uninstall] [--no-pull] [--dry-run] [-y] [-h]
#
# --no-pull sets up the runtime only and skips the image pull. uninstall removes
# the pulled fm-teleop image (the container runtime is left in place). The body is
# wrapped in main() and called on the last line, so a truncated curl|bash leaves
# an incomplete function that never runs.

install.sh — set up the fm-teleop host (macOS only)

Usage: ./install.sh [install|uninstall] [options]

  install      set up the container runtime, pull the fm-teleop image (default)
  uninstall    remove the pulled fm-teleop image (runtime is left in place)

Options:
  --no-pull    install path: set up the runtime only, skip the image pull
  --dry-run    print what would happen, change nothing
  -y, --yes    non-interactive; assume yes (CI mode)
  -h, --help   show this help

Env: FM_SELFTEST=1  load deps + resolve OS, then stop before any host change.
